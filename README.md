#Project: Decrypting Ciphertext using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
##Overview
This project demonstrates how Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be leveraged to decode ciphertext into meaningful plaintext. The approach uses statistical patterns and sequence alignment to break encryption schemes, highlighting the versatility of HMMs in real-world cryptography tasks.

##Features
Implementation of HMMs to analyze sequential data.
Decoding ciphertext based on probabilistic inference and pattern recognition.
Modular structure for training, evaluation, and decryption pipelines.

##Technologies Used
Python
NumPy, SciPy, and pandas
